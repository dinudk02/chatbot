ChatBot can be described as software that can chat with people using artificial intelligence. These software are used to perform tasks such as quickly responding to users, informing them, helping to purchase products and providing better service to customers.
 
 In this paper, we present the general working principle and the basic concepts of artificial intelligence based chatbots and related concepts as well as their applications in various sectors such as telecommunication, banking, health, customer call centers and e-commerce. Additionally, the results of an example chabbot for donation service developed for telecommunication service provider are presented using the proposed architecture.
 
When using the incremental model its vital to establish what functionality is required in each iteration to lead to the successful development of the project. If any new requirements are discovered during the development process they will either be added to an existing iteration if small or a new iteration will be added to the project plan.
 
 
   Analysis - This section will include various software methodologies; quantifiable feedback will be collected from questionnaires which will be analysed to identify the requirements of the chatbot. The internal and external hardware and system requirements are outlined. A Gantt chart will be provided outline the project schedule and when each milestone should be met.
 
 
 Design - This section will cover the overall design of the chatbot; UI diagrams/story boards will be included which detail how the GUI will appear to the user. The technical architecture will be designed and displayed in graphical form such as an activity diagram. It will outline how each component interacts with each other. The design for the database and the relationships between tables will be provided.
Implementation and testing - The section will document the implementation process to develop the solution, including; the code used to develop compelling features. Define what was learnt during each iteration and document each prototype. Once implementation is complete the chatbot will be tested using unit testing and appropriate test cases. Any errors or faults identified will be fixed to ensure maximum quality.
Evaluation and Reflection - An evaluation will be carried on the completed project to determine its quality and value. It will detail how the overall project was developed. Reflecting upon the overall experience, highlighting any areas that could be improved for future work and what well throughout the project.
